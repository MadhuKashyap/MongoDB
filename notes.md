### Introduction
üóÉÔ∏è 1. Database
A MongoDB database is a container for collections. It‚Äôs similar to a schema or database in SQL systems.<br/>
- You can have multiple databases.
- Each database is independent and stores its own collections and indexes.

üìÇ 2. Collection
A collection is like a table in relational databases. It holds documents.
- Collections do not enforce schemas (schema-less).
- A collection can store documents with different fields.

üìÑ 3. Document
A document is a single record in MongoDB. It‚Äôs stored in BSON format (Binary JSON), but you write and read it as JSON.
- Each document is a key-value pair object.
- Every document must have a unique _id field (auto-generated if not provided).

### Database Commands

1. Create database

```
use <database_name>
```
This will create a new database by provided name or use an existing one.

2. Show databases

```
show dbs
```
This will display all existing databases.

3. Delete database

```
use <database_name>
db.dropDatabase()
```

### Collection Commands

1. Create collection

```
db.createCollection("<collection_name>")
```

2. Insert 1 record

```
db.student.insertOne({ name: "Binay", age: 30, score: {"maths":65, "english":60 })
```
3. Insert multiple records

```
db.student.insertMany([{name:"Ajay",age:24, score:{"maths":85, "english":90 }},
                       {name:"Bina",age:24, score:{"maths":65, "english":60 }},
                       {name:"Ram",age:23, score:{"maths":55, "english":60 }}])
```
4. Delete single record

```
db.student.deleteOne({ name: "Ajay" })
```

5. Delete multiple records

```
db.student.deleteMany({ age: 24 })
```

6. Show all records

```
db.student.find()
```

7. Show record by filter
```
db.student.find({age:18})
```

8. Complex filter

```
db.student.find({score:{"maths":55, "english":60}})
```

9. Limit the row count

```
db.student.find().limit(2)
```

10. Sort output in asc

```
db.student.find().sort({ age: 1 })
```
